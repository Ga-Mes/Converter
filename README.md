These Python scripts create uncompressed video files. Such files can be played in my Turing Complete projects.

Note for display converter!
A resolution is ok if: (width % 6 = 0) and (height % 8 = 0)

To run any of the scripts you need to install following libraries:
- pygame
- pyvidplayer2

Download files and run them with your video.
